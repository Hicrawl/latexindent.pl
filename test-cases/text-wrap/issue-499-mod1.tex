with this. \paragraph{And with colors?} \emph{This long

	\item[Thing1:] This long line is not perfectly wrapped,
	 it seems the initial `item[Thing1:]' is not taken into
	 account in the count of characters. The following
	 lines get nicely wrapped as intended, no problem with
	 this.
	\item[Thing2:] This long line is also not perfectly
	 wrapped, it seems the initial `item[Thing2:]' is not
	 taken into account in the count of characters either.
	 The following lines get nicely wrapped as intended, no
	 problem with this.
